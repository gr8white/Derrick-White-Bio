      <p> Wassup guys, my name's Derrick! I'm from Atlanta, GA -just relocated to Houston in August, actually- and I graduated from the University of Georgia in May. I spent my college years learning about entrepreneurship and marketing because my goal is to start my own company and focus on the branding side of its development.</p>
      <p> A few years ago I had a great idea for a mobile app but I could never find anyone to build it for me without trying to charge me $12,000-$15,000 for the MVP alone. So, I decided to learn for myself. I can't wait to get started with this new journey with all of my classmates and I hope to make a bunch of new Houston friends in the process!! </p>
